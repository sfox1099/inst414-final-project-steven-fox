This repository contains my final project for INST414

Project Overview

A chemical machine and pipe manufacturing and distribution company called ChemX Solutions needs to
predict the useful life of its chemical products to prevent failures in the products it distributes to its
clients. Such failures could lead to environmental hazards, financial losses, and reputational damage. The
goal is to ensure that clients can rely on the safety and reliability of the ChemX products they use in their
operations. The company believes there is a way to estimate the useful life of its products by using data,
but it isnâ€™t sure what the models would look like or how to perform such analysis. As a newly hired Data
Scientist at ChemX Solutions, I am focused on creating models that use data to show the current state of
the product and when it is no longer safe for use. The metrics of success for this product will be a
visualized model of data for each product at ChemX Solutions that is currently in use by one of our
clients. In this way, we can gain valuable insight into our product's reliability, and drive sales volume by
sharing this data with our clients. In our context, the clients are those companies that operate chemical
processing plants and use our products in their operations.
